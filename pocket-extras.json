When you select the core, it'll immediately boot into Donkey Kong. Modern arcade cores allow you to choose a JSON file for the game you want to play, which allows the core to play multiple games, rather than just one.  Donkey Kong has many many romhacks, so I made some edits to the `data.json` which allows JSON to be selected.",
